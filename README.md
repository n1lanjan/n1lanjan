# 👋 Hi, I'm Nilanjan

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a technologist, startup founder, and engineering leader with 20+ years of experience in building enterprise SaaS, cybersecurity platforms, and cutting-edge AI tools. I love solving hard problems, writing clean code, and scaling products (and teams).

## 🚀 About Me

- 🔭 Currently building **[Ephor.ai](https://www.ephor.ai)** @ [Trilogy](https://trilogy.com/)— an AI platform to accelerate human learning using GenAI.
- 🧠 2X Founder
  - **FireCompass** — built a globally distributed attack surface management engine.
  - **iViZ Security** — the world's first SaaS-based Penetration Testing platform (acquired).
- 🛠️ Deeply hands-on: from full-stack development, LLMs & cloud optimization to DevOps and system architecture.
- 💡 3x US patent holder in cybersecurity and red teaming technologies.
- 💬 Often found mentoring teams, debugging gnarly infra bugs, or cracking CTFs.

## 🧗 Entrepreneurial Journey

### 🔐 iViZ Security (Acquired by Cigital, now Synopsys)

- Founded **iViZ Security** to bring cloud-native, on-demand **Penetration Testing as a Service** to the enterprise world — way before SaaS security was mainstream.
- Scaled engineering, delivery, and research teams to 100+.
- Published critical vulnerabilities in BitLocker, McAfee SafeBoot, BIOS, and AV tools.
- Raised VC funding, led the company to a successful acquisition by **Cigital**, later acquired by **Synopsys**.
- Integrated tech stacks post-acquisition, scaled operations and engineering to 120+, and drove 5x revenue growth.

### 🧠 FireCompass

- Co-founded FireCompass to enable **automated red teaming** and **attack surface management** at internet scale.
- Designed a **choreography-based distributed scanner** indexing 60TB+ from OSINT and threat intel feeds.
- Scaled ARR to $500K+, hired 40+ engineers, and raised venture funding.
